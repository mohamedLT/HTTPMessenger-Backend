# HTTPMessenger Backend
The backend for the Flutter messaging app built using Python and Django. It provides the API endpoints for the app to communicate with the server, enabling the sending and receiving of messages.

The backend uses Django's powerful ORM to manage the data and perform the necessary database operations. 

This project serves as a great example of how Django can be used to build a backend for a mobile app, and demonstrates the versatility of the framework in supporting different types of applications. It can be a valuable learning resource for anyone interested in developing a backend for a mobile app with Python and Django.
